  <p>1. We automatically generate and open-source a high-quality dataset for asynchronous planning which requires both sequential and parallel efficient sheduling. </p>

  <p>2. We find that LLMs are extremely poor when they are not supplied with detailed task illustrations for efficient asynchronous planning.</p>

  <p>3. We propose an off-the-shelf prompting method Plan Like a Graph (PLaG) and we show that PLaG consistently boosts SOTA model performance over all complexity levels.</p>

  <p>4. Despite the performance boost, we still find that LLMs tend to suffer from severe degradataion with increasing task complexities, which highlights the limitations of using LLMs to simulate digital devices.</p>
